I am a second year Masters student in the ECE department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I am currently working with Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and conducting research on abstractive text summarization. Prior to this I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I was fortunate enough to be advised by 2 wonderful people, [Shishir Kumar](https://shishirk.bitbucket.io/) and [Aditya Siripuram](https://iith.ac.in/ee/staditya/) during my undergraduate program. I have spent my childhood in the beautiful city of Mumbai and hail from [Nellore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellore) district of Andhra Pradesh, India.
