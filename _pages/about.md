I am a second year Masters student in the ECE department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Prior to this I completed my undergraduate degree at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I have spent my childhood in the beautiful city of Mumbai and hail from [Nellore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellore) district of Andhra Pradesh, India.
