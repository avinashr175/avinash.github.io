Hi, I am currently working as a machine learning engineering intern at [Primer.ai](https://primer.ai/). I recently finished my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). While I was in grad school, I worked with Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/), conducting research on abstractive text summarization. Prior to this I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I was fortunate enough to be advised by 2 wonderful people, [Shishir Kumar](https://shishirk.bitbucket.io/) and [Aditya Siripuram](https://iith.ac.in/ee/staditya/) during my undergraduate program. I have spent my childhood in the beautiful city of Mumbai and hail from [Nellore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellore) district of Andhra Pradesh, India. 
You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kNXkwpwewZ4KLxgYpqefYPIDYTdD-awT/view?usp=sharing)
