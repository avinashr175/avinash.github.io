Created a low cost syringe pump using a stepper motor and Arduino micro-controller. Fabricated the parts using a Mojo 3D printer. Enabled serial communication between Arduino and the computer using CoolTerm so that commands (for ex:- setting the flow rate) can be given by the user from terminal.This is a prototype of a syringe pump which can be used in applications where we require a fixed and precise fluid rate. A lot of credit goes to Prof. C. A. Varnon who has already created an open source syringe pump, from which we have adapted quite a few ideas. You can find the working demo of the prototype at this [link](https://youtu.be/IowGbcP8V7E)
