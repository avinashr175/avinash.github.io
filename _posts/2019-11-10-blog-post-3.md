Humans have mastered the method of creating artistic images of different styles using methodology unique to them. Art and painting style is all about percep-
tion and hence is considered a interplay of content and style of the scene to be described. Current world art has classified painting styles in different categories
like Modernism, Figurative Art etc. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However,advances in visual perception and recognition tasks using deep learning methods opens great opportunities for its extension to develop a system for style and contentlearning. This project attempts to understand the use of deep neural net architectures for learning and transfer of style and content of a given image.
