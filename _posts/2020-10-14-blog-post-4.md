Abstractâ€”Super resolution techniques are useful in a
range of industry applications from medical imaging and
diagnosis to security and surveillance utilization. Since
resolution enhancement of visual data from an imaging
hardware point of view is costly, sensitive to environmental
conditions, and time consuming, post-processing super
resolution methods are a reasonable solution to improving
the performance and analysis of imaging applications. In
this paper, we analyze the performance of a modified
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based super resolution
algorithm on a variety of image acquisition types. A wavelet
transform provides a detail as well as coarse separation of
the contents of the image. We design a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to predict the missing details (residuals) in
the wavelet coefficients of the low-resolution images to
obtain high-resolution images. The network has multiple
input and output channels which allows it to learn the
different structures at different levels of the image.
