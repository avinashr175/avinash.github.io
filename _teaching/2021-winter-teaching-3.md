I was a tutor and reader for ECE 109 offered by [Prof. Alex](https://cmrr.ucsd.edu/research/faculty-profiles/vardy.html). [Link to course website](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi21/ece109/) 
This course is an introduction to probability for engineers. You will have the opportunity to learn basic concepts that are used extensively in such areas as machine learning and data science, robotics and control, communication systems, and signal processing. In fact, probability plays a crucial role in many disciplines beyond engineering --- computational genomics, quantum mechanics, and stock market analysis, to name a few.
